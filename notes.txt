3/31 Notes
Kevin not a huge fan of the legend,
took a screenshot
infections vs mortality in the scan
five 38 has a mortality per thousand use their color scheme

the layer aboe it should be heat bubbles based on the number of cases
lifehacker has a site up that i can look at
make it two things up here so you have the map and you have the bar graph like
http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/
vintage - population analytics (loss triangles)
the bubbles will need to be overlayed in there because they talk about the spread. need to be able
to turn the circles off on/off switch


4/2
Might be a good idea to add in census data then too
If we can show % infected and % dead
NYC is a very dense city, we should show

Certain toggles will adjust the bubbles and others will adjust the colors
